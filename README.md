# First Issue - An Open Source Matchmaker

First Issue helps developers find beginner-friendly open source issues that match their skills.

It analyzes a GitHub profile or allows manual language selection to recommend relevant `good first issues`.

---

## Overview

The system connects a user’s skillset with suitable open source contributions by:

- Fetching repositories from GitHub
- Identifying most used programming languages
- Searching for beginner-friendly issues
- Ranking them based on relevance and repository quality

For users without public repositories, the system supports manual language selection to generate recommendations.
